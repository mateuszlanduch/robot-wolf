Robot wolf is a multifunctional robot controlled by IR pilot using RC5 standard

Robot functions:
1. Control: front, rear, right, left, stop, horn.
2. Line-follower
3. Automatic drive mode
4. More features and fritzing scheme coming soon...

Right now I'm working on some improvements for automatic drive mode. Right now it's not possible to interrupt automatic drive mode, robot will drive automatically for 20 second and stop itself.
